# ShopEase
ShopEase is a groundbreaking web application transforming local shopping. As a decentralized platform, it connects users with nearby shops offering specific products, empowering small businesses and expanding their reach without extra costs. Built with the MERN stack and implemented as a Progressive Web App (PWA), ShopEase delivers a seamless, app-like experience across devices.
Our objectives include developing an intuitive user interface for streamlined product searches, implementing robust backend functionalities for reliable data management and real-time communication with businesses, establishing a comprehensive database of nearby shops for inclusivity, and solidifying ShopEase as a PWA to enhance accessibility across various devices and operating systems. Welcome to a new era of local shopping convenience with ShopEase!
